  <h1>Work and going back to the Valley</h1>
  <p>
    from ocean vuong, lilac softeners:
    not a junkie; never having assembled the parts of a computer, loved cars when they were little, drive their dads 2021 porches with the music a little too loud inside
    and the turns carried with never a care for the brakes, because more milage on the glassy new odometer, the few could slow them down
    dark chocolate pretzels, cans of coke with tops slightly ajar, a sip taken out and the rest left to fizz to death. cookie cutter plates and painted lady bowls, half a loaf of bread
    untouched since a couple months ago, a jar of vegetable oil with a coat of waxy plastic wrap, and a leftover bowl of same oil from dinner. 
    fireplace burning wood made of metal, window to nowhere, four stems of rosemary burned to black, an room washed with the stillness of a dense summer night, what I had then was a pieces of porcelain and memories from when I had thrown a 1992 stilser glass, an old world map and a scarlet children's rubber ball, miraculously fingerprint free.
    a taiyaki with the inside, a hardness of stone. a five yen piece thrown into a wishing well, a rock that was softer and lighter to pick up than one might have imagined it,
    a sure sign of fortune, the city builds the glass towers only to the edge of the emperors palace, that is to say that a yuppie standing at the highest floor could only see the shrubbery up to as high as the stone exterior walls, never to the inside. which is to say the human eye is limited to the extent of our reach.
    to love one was to love ones work as surely as the love was to the child and the stuff animal, and to the adult and to the stuffed animal whose fur was the smell of rosemary and rose softener
    there are only around a dozen houses by the waterfront. you climb on top of a rock and feel the world as like atlas felt it. 10 boating docks, three stretches of public sand, one notion of existingi n a space for an
    someone by the water, someone by the sea. someone on a path walking besides a river, someone below dead moth
