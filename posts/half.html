  <h1>1/2</h1>
  
  <p>Something about the blue LEDs that look like they might be used to backlight a waterfall, and barely audible conversation over the monotonous undertone of air rushing by the plane makes for efficient writing. Not the best, but efficient.</p>

  <p>It's scary to report that after this semester, I will be halfway through college. Halfway! When you say half, it comes out so quietly and yet reading "1/2" is particularly difficult on the eyes. The denominator isn't helping. Three (3) semesters have come and gone so much faster than I might have imagined, and I was thinking how I literally could not remember any of the courses I took freshman year second semester (which was last year).</p>

  <p>I think I've been jumping around a lot, research-wise, interests-wise, courses-wise, and while it's been good to poke around a little bit and see what I like, I think I want to make this semester the one where I settle in, dig deep. In general, I would like to be more mindful. I don't really take much time to myself between working on one thing or another, and I always think I don't have time for anything extraneous - I def do. I would also like to do this: I have this thing where if I leave something off on a self-perceived good-note, whether a project or a conversation, I will try to fester on that good thing for as long as possible. Like a gift that keeps giving, one that I don't wanna open in fear of ruining the surprise. I'm putting my foot down on that.</p>
  
  <p>So, I'm making some goals for myself this semester. A bucket list. In no particular order:</p>
  <ul><li>Straight As.</li>
  <li>Begin iterating on assignments/research advice the day I receive it - don't wait.</li>
  <li>Make significant project progress, secure first-authorship.</li>
  <li>After the above, secure a research internship for this summer.</li>
  <li>30 mins workout, all 5 weekdays.</li>
  <li>Keep my task list updated.</li>
  <li>Secure a research award, preferably monetary too.</li>
  <li>Help revise Allison's college apps cada dia.</li>
  <li>Write one of these every two weeks.</li>
  <li>Read a book every day.</li>
  <li>Go out to eat at least once every two weeks.</li></ul>
  <p>Ik this seems performative, but y'know, no one will see it anyways...</p>
